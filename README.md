What is the issue that industries are facing and how our project aims to provide solutions for them?
```


The maintenance of machines poses significant challenges, leading to frequent breakdowns, decreased productivity, increased downtime, and higher costs.
The industry still focuses on REACTIVE, Periodic and PROACTIVE maintenance instead of predictive maintenance.
